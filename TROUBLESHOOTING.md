# Enabling Comments on YouTube

If you see "Comments are disabled", you must enable them on YouTube directly:

## Scenario A: The Dropdown Works
1.  Go to **[YouTube Studio](https://studio.youtube.com/)**.
2.  Click **Content** > Select your video.
3.  Scroll down to **Show More**.
4.  Find **Comments and ratings**.
5.  Select **"On"**.
6.  **Save**.

## Scenario B: The Dropdown is Locked/Grayed Out (Most Likely)
If you cannot click the dropdown, it means your video is set as "Made for Kids".

1.  In the same video settings page, scroll **UP** to the **"Audience"** section.
2.  You will see "Yes, it's made for kids" selected.
3.  **Change it to "No, it's not made for kids".**
    *   *YouTube legally disables comments on kids' content.*
4.  **Save** the video.
5.  Now scroll back down — the Comments dropdown will be unlocked! Set it to **"On"**.
